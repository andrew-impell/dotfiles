#: Color scheme {{{


foreground #cecccf
background #111116

#: The foreground and background colors

# background_opacity       0.7
# dynamic_background_opacity no

#: The opacity of the background. A number between 0 and 1, where 1 is
#: opaque and 0 is fully transparent.  This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the default background color's
#: opacity. This is so that things like the status bar in vim,
#: powerline prompts, etc. still look good.  But it means that if you
#: use a color theme with a background color in your editor, it will
#: not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the
#: default background color in your kitty config and not use a
#: background color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape
#: codes to set the terminals default colors in a shell script to
#: launch your editor.  Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a
#: (possibly significant) performance hit.  If you want to dynamically
#: change transparency of windows set dynamic_background_opacity to
#: yes (this is off by default as it has a performance cost)

dim_opacity 0.75

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

selection_foreground #d5c4a1
selection_background #4c566a

#: The foreground and background for text selected with the mouse


#: The 16 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a
#: dull and bright version. You can also set the remaining colors from
#: the 256 color table as color16 to color255.

#: Fonts
#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

font_family      SF Mono
bold_font        auto
italic_font      auto
bold_italic_font auto

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. By default they are derived automatically, by the OSes
#: font system. Setting them manually is useful for font families that
#: have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For
#: example::

#:     font_family      Operator Mono Book
#:     bold_font        Operator Mono Medium
#:     italic_font      Operator Mono Book Italic
#:     bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic

font_size 10.0


#: Font size (in pts)

adjust_line_height  1
# adjust_column_width 0

#: Change the size of each character cell kitty renders. You can use
#: either numbers, which are interpreted as pixels or percentages
#: (number followed by %), which are interpreted as percentages of the
#: unmodified values. You can use negative pixels or percentages less
#: than 100% to reduce sizes (but this might cause rendering
#: artifacts).

#symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A2,U+E0B0-U+E0B3 PowerlineSymbols

#: Map the specified unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful
#: if you need special rendering for some symbols, such as for
#: Powerline. Avoids the need for patched fonts. Each unicode code
#: point is specified in the form U+<code point in hexadecimal>. You
#: can specify multiple code points, separated by commas and ranges
#: separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple
#: times. Syntax is::

#:     symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name

# box_drawing_scale 0.001, 1, 1.5, 2

#: Change the sizes of the lines used for the box drawing unicode
#: characters These values are in pts. They will be scaled by the
#: monitor DPI to arrive at a pixel value. There must be four values
#: corresponding to thin, normal, thick, and very thick lines.

#:

#: Cursor customization {{{

cursor #d8dee9

#: Default cursor color

cursor_text_color #2e3440

#: Choose the color of text under the cursor. If you want it rendered
#: with the background color of the cell underneath instead, use the
#: special keyword: background

# cursor_shape block

#: The cursor shape can be one of (block, beam, underline)

# cursor_blink_interval      0.5
# cursor_stop_blinking_after 15.0

#: The interval (in seconds) at which to blink the cursor. Set to zero
#: to disable blinking. Note that numbers smaller than repaint_delay
#: will be limited to repaint_delay. Stop blinking cursor after the
#: specified number of seconds of keyboard inactivity. Set to zero to
#: never stop blinking.

#: }}}

#: Scrollback {{{

# scrollback_lines 2000

#: Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
#: Memory is allocated on demand. Negative numbers are (effectively)
#: infinite scrollback. Note that using very large scrollback is not
#: recommended a it can slow down resizing of the terminal and also
#: use large amounts of RAM.

# scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER

#: Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The
#: scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change
#: it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences
#: for colors and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command
#: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
#: should be at the top of the screen.

# wheel_scroll_multiplier 5.0

#: Modify the amount scrolled by the mouse wheel. Note this is only
#: used for low precision scrolling devices, not for high precision
#: scrolling on platforms such as macOS and Wayland. Use negative
#: numbers to change scroll direction.
